<p><em>by Rishi Kothari</em></p>
<p>This version of the Codill book—a readable course into JavaScript—assumes basic knowledge of programming (for 
instance, what the terminal is and how to use a web browser).</p>
<p>You may find the source code of this book on <a href="https://z.rishi.cx/g/codill">the Codill GitHub Repository</a>, and the 
official mirror at <a href="https://codill.rishi.cx">codill.rishi.cx</a>.</p>
<p>This book was written over the course of two months in 2021, with support from Nathan Couckuyt from Turner Fenton 
Secondary School in Brampton, Ontario.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#foreword" id="foreword">Foreword</a></h1>
<p>The 1990s was a time of extreme change. Today, we look back on those days (even those of us that weren't born 
then—like me!) with nostalgia. The remnants of the 90s can be seen just about everywhere today, from the tiny 
smartphones in our pockets running SMS software and systems to Linux—which is in just about every piece of 
technology out there.</p>
<p>However, after one fateful 10 day period</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>Hello there!</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#getting-started" id="getting-started">Getting Started</a></h1>
<p>Let's get you started with JavaScript! Your journey into web programming begins here.</p>
<p>This chapter will go through the basics of installation, common tools in the JS ecosystem, runtimes, and some 
initial programs to run to get you started with JavaScript!</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#installation" id="installation">Installation</a></h1>
<p>For the majority of this book, we'll be using Node.js as our runtime, for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>Node is simple above all else. Instead of needing to learn HTML, CSS, and dozens of other web technologies to execute JS in your browser, you only need one command in the terminal. It's an excellent tool to learn the basics of programming as a whole!</p>
<p>Node is also not a sandboxed environment; it has very few restrictions on the things that you can do with it, and even those can be bypassed. This also leaves some programs vulnerable to attack, which is why JS developers that use Node usually look through their external programs to see if they're insecure. All of this means that we can do many more things with Node than we would by sticking to the convention.</p>
<p>Finally, Node uses a modified version of a browser JS runtime under the hood, so we can rest assured that the concepts and programs we write can be run just about anywhere. Node uses V8 (Google Chrome's JS runtime environment) under the hood, which is also why it's incredibly fast!</p>
<p>To install Node, head over to <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">the Node website</a> and click &quot;Install&quot;.</p>
<p>When you've gone through all the instructions, make sure to run <code>node -v</code> in your terminal.</p>
<p>If you get an error saying something like &quot;Unknown command: node,&quot; try reinstalling it and trying again.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#runtimes" id="runtimes">Runtimes</a></h1>
<p>Chances are, you've already interacted with JavaScript in some way, shape or form. As was stated in the
<a href="chapter_1/../introduction.html">introduction</a>, JS is usually used in web programming; many websites use JavaScript to allow
user interaction, rich updating, and so on. To run the JavaScript that developers write for their websites, your
browser also includes what's known as a JavaScript <em>runtime</em> environment.</p>
<p>A runtime environment is nothing more than a place that code can run. However, there are many moving parts to a runtime environment. These pieces of a given runtime change based on the language, but we will discuss that more extensively in <a href="chapter_1/">Chapter 6</a>. In essence, a runtime holds all the bits and pieces that you need to execute a program: standard libraries, an executor, and so forth. Don't worry if those words confuse you right now—it's perfectly normal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each browser has their own proprietary JavaScript runtime environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Chrome uses a runtime known as <strong>V8</strong>, which is written in C++ and open source.</li>
<li>Mozilla Firefox executes Javascript through its <strong>SpiderMonkey</strong> environment</li>
<li><strong>JavascriptCore</strong> is what Safari uses, and its adoption has influenced the way that JavaScript has been shaped through the ages.</li>
<li>Before Microsoft Edge came, Internet Explorer used <strong>Chakra</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Behind the fancy names, each of these 'runtimes' do the exact same thing in each browser: give JS programs a space to run.</p>
<p>However, browsers are just one possible application of JS; as we investigated earlier, it can also be used to write things like servers, interact with your computer's file system, create blockchains, among thousands of other possibilities. Browsers can't do these things because they are sandboxed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In programming, 'sandboxing' is a colloquial term for isolating an environment. In real life, sand from a sandbox can get everywhere—you wouldn't want it getting on any of the playground equipment, would you? When you go to a website, the JS code that is run can be similarly damaging; if it is given access to, say, the file system, then who knows what developers could do with a simple link?</p>
<p>In the same way that physical sandboxes are built away from other places, browser runtime environments are sandboxed (they restrict certain features) to make sure that the JS that is run can't do anything malicious.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we do need access to the full computing power of a machine, then we need to go lower. JavaScript can also be run in the terminal through runtimes like Node.js!</p>
<p>For instance, you can't access the file system through a browser webpage because of security &amp; sandboxing. On the other hand, because Node.js is a lower level developer tool by nature and doesn't have restrictions, it allows JS code to use more functions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Low level&quot; in programming means the level of abstraction that something provides. For instance, JS can't directly interact with a computer's RAM because it is a <em>high level</em> language. Something like C or Rust, on the other hand, are lower level languages, and they <em>can</em>. Node is a lower level JavaScript runtime; it has more system privileges.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1><a class="header" href="#hello-world" id="hello-world">Hello, World!</a></h1>
<p>Now that you've installed your JS runtime, we can finally get into learning the language!</p>
<p>Before we do that, though, we need to go through some command line basics.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-command-line" id="the-command-line">The command line</a></h2>
<p>Unlike the fancy GUIs (graphic user interfaces) that browsers provide, terminals are fairly barebones. They consist of one screen, a scrolling piece of text, and a little place to input some text.</p>
<p>Because terminals are so minimalist, they can also do a <em>lot</em> of things! They give developers complete control over their computers, which is also why they're the tool of choice when building lower level projects. GUIs are a higher level abstraction over the things that can be done in terminals.</p>
<p>To run a command, click on your terminal window and run <code>$ node</code> without typing in the <code>$</code> (when you see code blocks that begin with <code>$</code>, the text after the dollar sign symbolizes the command that you should run) into the terminal, like so:</p>
<p><img src="chapter_1/assets/terminal_node.png" alt="Node command in terminal" /></p>
<p>When you press the 'Enter' key, the command that you typed into the terminal gets run, and you should see your screen update to something like this:</p>
<p><img src="chapter_1/assets/run.png" alt="Run command" /></p>
<p>Congratulations! You've run your very first command line program.</p>
<p>Commands can also take in arguments to change their behaviour.</p>
<p>For instance, running <code>$ echo</code> won't do anything, but the <code>echo</code> command takes in arguments. This command simply logs out a piece of text. Try running <code>$ echo hi</code>. Did the word 'hi' pop up on your screen? In this case, &quot;hi&quot; was the argument passed into <code>echo</code>.</p>
<p>There are millions of commands out there to interact with, and each of them has their own usage semantics. This book will largely focus on the <code>node</code> and <code>npm</code> (we'll get to the latter a little later) commands, but feel free to experiment with anything you come across on your journey!</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-node-command" id="the-node-command">The <code>node</code> command</a></h2>
<p>When you run <code>$ node</code>, something odd happens. You don't return to the normal line in your shell for input, you get entered into a kind of sub-terminal. This is what's known as a REPL; a Read, Evaluate, Print Loop. It's a common method of learning a language, and allows you to run single lines of a language for execution.</p>
<p>Whenever a code block starts with a <code>&gt;</code> in this book, you should run the text after it in Node's REPL (you can access it anytime by running <code>$ node</code>).</p>
<p>This REPL is also going to be the place that we run our first JavaScript program!</p>
<p>Try running <code>&gt; console.log(&quot;hello&quot;)</code> in the REPL, like so:</p>

<p>When you've run that, you should see &quot;hello&quot; pop up in your output!</p>
<p>Give yourself a pat on the back—you're officially a JS developer. This single line of code is perfect idiomatic JavaScript, and Node's just executed it flawlessly!</p>
<p>Don't worry about understanding this piece of code right now; all that you need to move forwards is the ability to open up a terminal and get to Node's REPL.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#files-with-the-node-command" id="files-with-the-node-command">Files with the <code>node</code> command</a></h2>
<p>Node wouldn't be very useful if it could only execute programs line by line with no ability to save. Luckily, you can execute JS programs in Node from files by passing in a parameter for the file's name.</p>
<p>To try this out, run the following commands in your terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ cd ~
$ touch index.js
$ echo 'console.log(3)' &gt; index.js
$ node index.js
</code></pre>
<p>The first line changes directories (the equivalent of clicking on a different folder in your file explorer) into what's known as your 'home' directory (the top level of your file tree).</p>
<p>The second line creates a file named <code>index.js</code>, and the third simply puts the line of JS code <code>console.log(3)</code> into it, using the pipe operator.</p>
<p>Finally, we pass the name of the local file into the <code>node</code> command to run it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alternatively, you can use one of the many thousands of online code execution platforms out there. <a href="https://replit.com">Replit</a> is a popular online editor for running Node programs; if you don't want to go through the pain of constantly switching between directories, using their Node template can be a good shortcut.</p>

<p>Before moving on, make sure you can answer the following questions for yourself (answers are provided):</p>
<details>
  <summary>Q: What is the terminal, and why is it used in development more than GUIs?</summary>
<p><strong>A:</strong> A terminal is a text-based system for interacting with a computer. Because the only possible interactions between a user and the terminal are through text, it's much easier to develop a program for the command line than it is to develop one with a GUI. As such, terminals have far more capabilities than regular GUI applications do; this flexibility means that developers can be more efficient in their work with the terminal.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Q: What is a runtime in programming? What is V8?</summary>
<p><strong>A:</strong> A runtime environment is simply a toolset that gives developers the ability to execute programs in a given language on their machine. V8 is the runtime that Google Chrome uses to execute JavaScript, and was adapted for the terminal by Node.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Q: What is a REPL?</summary>
<p><strong>A:</strong> REPL stands for Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop. It is a simple way of executing programs line-by-line (generating output each time a new line is created), and is a useful way of learning a new language.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#basic-programming-concepts" id="basic-programming-concepts">Basic Programming Concepts</a></h1>
<p>Now that you understand the basics of running a JS program (and have already written a little bit), we can finally move onto the real bits and pieces of the language. These programming concepts are largely language-independent; they transfer well to other programming language, and are the base of programming as a whole.</p>
<p>This chapter will cover:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h1><a class="header" href="#primitive-types" id="primitive-types">Primitive Types</a></h1>
<p>Let's go back to the first function that you wrote in JS: <code>console.log('hello')</code>. All that this function does is log out 'hello' to the console through what's known as a function call (we'll get to those later). However, it wouldn't function if not for the little word in between the two quotes: <code>'hello'</code>. This is an example of a <em>primitive type</em> in JavaScript.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In programming, a <em>type</em> is just a piece of data that represents something. In the real world, a car is a <em>type</em> of vehicle, and 3 is a type of number. JS has similar constructs to be able to perform operations. For instance, storing a number in memory allows you to add other numbers to it; this is an operation that can only be done between two values of type <code>number</code>.</p>
<p>A &quot;primitive&quot; type is the most basic type in the language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In JavaScript, there are a few basic (primitive) types that you should know about: numbers, strings, <code>null</code>, <code>undefined</code>, <code>boolean</code>s, and <code>Symbol</code>s.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#numbers" id="numbers">Numbers</a></h2>
<p>Quite obviously, a value of type <code>number</code> in JavaScript is, well, a number. There are two sub-types that you should know about: integers and floats.</p>
<p>Integers are what you would represent the <em>natural</em> numbers with: numbers like 1, -3, 16, and so on are integers, but something like 3.14 is not. Anything with a decimal is called a floating-point number, or float for short.</p>
<p>In your terminal, run <code>node</code> to start up your REPL. To start playing around with numbers in JS, try typing in a few:</p>
<pre><code>$ node
&gt; 3
3
&gt; 15
15
&gt; -15.32
</code></pre>
<p>You can also try doing some basic operations on numbers:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; 15 + 3
18
&gt; 19.5 + 0.4
19.9
&gt; -4 * 5 + 3
-17
</code></pre>
<p>Here are all of the basic operators that you can perform on two numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Addition/Subtraction with <code>+</code> and <code>-</code></li>
<li>Multiplication/Division with <code>*</code> and <code>/</code></li>
<li>Exponentiation with <code>**</code> (an equation like \( 2^5 \) might be represented by <code>2**5</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>JavaScript operations also supported boosted operation precedence. By default, operations are right-associated, with precedence following from basic BEDMAS rules. For instance, if you wanted to evaluate an expression that looked something like: \( 20 - [3 \times (2 + 4)] \), you could run <code>&gt; 20 - (3 * (2 + 4))</code>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#strings" id="strings">Strings</a></h2>
<p>Numbers are fun to use, but what if you wanted to represent something a little bit more complex, like a piece of text? This is where the <code>string</code> type comes in.</p>
<p>Strings are just sequences of UTF-8 encoded characters stored in memory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>UTF stands for Unicode Transformation Format, and is a simple form of representing text and characters using binary numbers. Computers have to store data in particular ways—we use 1s and 0s at the lowest level of computing, and using UTF-8 gives programmers an efficient way to encode characters into numbers for storage in memory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In JavaScript, strings can be defined by using 3 types of quotations: <code>'</code>, <code>&quot;</code>, and the backtick character (&quot;`&quot;).</p>
<pre><code>&gt; &quot;Hello there!&quot;
Hello there!
&gt; 'Heyo.'
Heyo.
&gt; `Greetings, human!`
Greetings, human!
</code></pre>
<p>Just like numbers, you can perform certain operations on strings.</p>
<p>Adding two strings together using <code>+</code> is called string concatenation (usually shortened to concat), and joins two strings together:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; 'hello' + ' ' + 'there'
'hello there'
</code></pre>
<p>JavaScript is also a dynamic language, which means that its type safety rules aren't very strict. This means that you can also use other types of values in string operations! For instance, if we wanted to show the result of a numeric addition in JavaScript, we could write something like:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; 'The result of 1 + 2 is: ' + (1 + 2)
'The result of 1 + 2 is: 3'
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>The process of changing types in programming is known as type <em>casting</em> (or just casting for short). In the above code snippet, we first add 1 to 2, then cast the result to type <code>string</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is here that we also start to discover some of the flaws of JavaScript. Dynamic typing gives us powerful ways to write concise programs, but the rules that govern types also become a bit odd. Let's see what happens if we remove the parenthesis from the code snippet above:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; 'The result of 1 + 2 is: ' + 1 + 2
'The result of 1 + 2 is: 12'
</code></pre>
<p>...what just happened? Instead of getting the result of 3 in the string, we get 12.</p>
<p>This might seem weird at first glance, but think back to the section on Numbers in JavaScript. When evaluating expressions, JS will go from left to right—just like in math. The first thing that JS sees is: <code>'The result of 1 + 2 is: ' + 1</code>, and so it casts the number <code>1</code> to a string and adds it to the first string, then repeats the process for the second number.</p>
<p>These kinds of errors are quite common when writing JavaScript, and it's always important to think programs through before getting flustered.</p>
<p>Let's try doing some more interesting operations with numbers. What if we wanted to add a <code>string</code> that contains a number to a <code>number</code>?</p>
<pre><code>&gt; 2 + '2'
'22'
</code></pre>
<p>This illustrates another important part of JavaScript's type casting rules: you cannot cast down types. Strings are not guaranteed to be numbers, which is why instead of casting the string to a number and adding the two as <code>number</code> types, the <code>number</code> gets casted to a <code>string</code>, and the two get concatenated.</p>
<p>A string's value might not always be a number, but a number can <em>always</em> be a string: numbers are just sequences of characters, after all.</p>
<p>You can get a specific character of a string by adding square brackets with an index after a string:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; 'hello there'[0]
'h'
&gt; 'hello there'[3]
'l'
&gt; 'hello there'[10]
'e'
</code></pre>
<p>Strings are <em>zero-indexed</em>, which means that the first character has index 0. In the code snippet above, accessing the character at index 0 returns <code>'h'</code>, which is indeed the first character in the sequence.</p>
<p>To get the length of a string, you can use the <code>.length</code> <em>property</em> of string types. Don't worry about what that means just yet—just think of it as an associated value of a given type. We'll be looking at properties a little bit more in <a href="chapter_2//chapter_2/objects.html">Section 2.6 and further</a>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; 'hello there'.length
11
</code></pre>
<p><code>.length</code> returns a value of type <code>number</code>, and we can use this to do some interesting calculations! Remember when I said that strings are zero-indexed? That means that the last character of the string will always be at the index of the length of the string minus one:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; 'hello there'.length - 1
10
&gt; 'hello there'[10]
'e'
&gt; 'hello there'['hello there'.length - 1]
'e'
</code></pre>
<p>If this seems a little bit repetitive, that's because it is. There are ways to get around this repetition called <em>variables</em>, but we'll be getting to that in the next section.</p>
<p>To make strings lowercase, you can use their <code>.toLowerCase()</code> method (a type of property that's a function):</p>
<pre><code>&gt; 'Hey There'.toLowerCase()
'hey there'
</code></pre>
<p>There's also <code>.toUpperCase()</code>, which does exactly what you think it might do: it makes a string uppercased!</p>
<pre><code>&gt; 'hello there'.toUpperCase()
'HELLO THERE'
</code></pre>
<p>We can use <code>.replace(old, new)</code> to replace certain pieces of a string with others:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; 'hello there'.replace('hello', 'hey')
'hey there'
</code></pre>
<p>To search a string, we can use <code>.search(str)</code>, which returns the index of the given search query (and returns <code>-1</code> if it isn't found):</p>
<pre><code>&gt; 'hello there'.search('h')
0
&gt; 'hello there'.search('ello')
1
&gt; 'hello there'.search('not found')
-1
&gt; 'hello there'.search('th')
6
</code></pre>
<p>To get a subselection of a string, we can use <code>.slice(start, end)</code>, where <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> are indices of the given string. <code>start</code> is 0-indexed, while <code>end</code> is 1-indexed. To capture the string from a given index to the end, you can supply one parameter to <code>.slice</code> (just the first one):</p>
<pre><code>&gt; 'hello there'.slice(0, 3)
'hel'
&gt; 'hello there'.slice(0, 5)
'hello'
&gt; 'hello there'.slice(3)
'lo there'
</code></pre>
<p>We can repeat (or multiply) strings by using the <code>.repeat(n)</code> method:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; 'hello there'.repeat(3)
'hello therehello therehello there'
</code></pre>
<p>All functions that return the same type are chainable (which means that you can easily repeat them or run them sequentially):</p>
<pre><code>&gt; 'hello there'.repeat(3).toUpperCase()
'HELLO THEREHELLO THEREHELLO THERE'
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#boolean" id="boolean">Boolean</a></h2>
<p>Since computer programs deal in binary, what happens if we want to represent a value that's either true or false? This is where values of type <code>boolean</code> come in.</p>
<p>There are two values that correspond to <code>boolean</code>s: <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>, which are <em>reserved keywords</em> in JS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <em>reserved keyword</em> is just a word or a piece of text that the language uses for its own features. You can define keywords of your own using variables (which we'll see later), but certain words in the language (like <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>) are reserved by the language, and cannot be redefined.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&gt; true
true
&gt; false
false
</code></pre>
<p>Pretty simple, right? Booleans are used primarily as ways to compare values. For instance, we can compare if two values are equal to each other using the <code>===</code> operator, which outputs a boolean:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; 1 === 2
false
&gt; '1' === 1
false
</code></pre>
<p>There are a whole host of other operators that we can use to compare values and output booleans.</p>
<p>There are two equality operators in JS: <code>===</code> and <code>==</code> (we saw the former in the last code snippet). Fundamentally, they do the same thing: check if two values are equal. However, the operator with 3 equal signs also checks the <em>type</em> of the values that are being passed. <code>===</code> is aptly named the strict equality operator, and <code>==</code> is dubbed the loose equality operator:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; '1' === 1
false
&gt; '1' == 1
true
</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, we can check if two values are not equal to each other using the strict inequality check <code>!==</code> and the loose inequality operator <code>!=</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; 1 != 2
true
&gt; 1 != '2'
true
</code></pre>
<p>We can also compare numbers using the <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code> and <code>&gt;=</code> operators, which correspond to 'greater than', 'less than', 'less than or equal to', and 'greater than or equal to' respectively:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; 3 &gt; 2
true
&gt; 3 &gt;= 3
true
&gt; 1 &lt; 2
true
&gt; 2 &gt; 3
false
</code></pre>
<p>We can also use the logical comparison operators <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code>, which are the AND and OR comparators respectively. We use these to compare between booleans:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; true || false
true
&gt; true &amp;&amp; false
false
&gt; 3 &gt; 2 &amp;&amp; 1 &gt; 2
false
&gt; 3 &gt; 2 || 1 &gt; 2
true
</code></pre>
<p>The negation operator <code>!</code> also exists:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; !true
false
&gt; !false
true
&gt; !!false
false
</code></pre>
<p>Other values can be implicitly casted to booleans as well. If a value can be casted to <code>true</code>, we call it <em>truthy</em>. If it casts to <code>false</code>, we call it <em>falsy</em>.</p>
<p>Generally, values that represent nothing or 0 get casted to <code>false</code>, and values that <em>do</em> represent something get casted to <code>true</code>. To convert a value to a boolean, you can use double negation (<code>!!</code>) or the <code>Boolean(value)</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; !!''
false
&gt; !!0
false
&gt; Boolean('')
false
&gt; Boolean(0)
false
&gt; Boolean(3230)
true
&gt; Boolean(' ')
true
</code></pre>
<p>Don't worry if you can't remember all the type casting rules right now—as you use JS more and more, it'll just become second nature to you (and you'll build more efficient programs along with it).</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#null-and-undefined" id="null-and-undefined">Null and undefined</a></h2>
<p>There are two other important reserved keywords that will pop up ofte when writing JavaScript: <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code>, and they have the same underlying purpose: to represent nothing at all.</p>
<p>Both are falsy, and they are equal to each other:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; Boolean(undefined)
false
&gt; Boolean(null)
false
&gt; undefined == null
true
</code></pre>
<p>While they might seem to be the exact same, there are some subtle differences. <code>null</code> represents literal nothingness: if you're instantiating a value, you can pass <code>null</code> as a primitive value. However, if something's been declared but hasn't been defined, <code>undefined</code> will be returned.</p>
<p>The key difference between the two is that <code>null</code> is meant to be used as an actual value that you can pass around, and <code>undefined</code> just represents the abscence of a definition—you shouldn't use it manually in programs too often as a developer.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#symbol" id="symbol">Symbol</a></h2>
<p>The last of the primitive type is also one of the most interesting and complex. The <code>Symbol</code> type is meant to represent nothing more than a unique value; all things considered, this is also the one that will pop up the least in your daily development needs.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; Symbol() === Symbol()
false
&gt; Symbol()
Symbol()
</code></pre>
<p>These don't get used too often on their own, but when combined with things like arrays and objects, can be extremely useful when tracking entities. Don't worry if you don't completely understand this year—it's perfectly natural. Most professional JS devs go their whole careers barely using this primitive type.</p>
