# Basic Programming Concepts

Now that you understand the basics of running a JS program (and have already written a little bit), we can finally move onto the real bits and pieces of the language. These programming concepts are largely language-independent; they transfer well to other programming language, and are the base of programming as a whole.

This chapter will cover:

- [Primitive Types](types.md)
- [Variables](variables.md)
- [Functions](functions.md)
- [The `for` loop](for.md)
- [The `while` loop](while.md)
- [Objects & Lists](objects.md)
